### What Are RSS(RES) and VSZ(VIRT) in Linux Memory Management?

RSS(RES, Resident memory size) and VSZ(VIRT, Virtual memory size) are two frequently seen indicators of how much memory a program is using in the Linux environment, either via `ps` or `top`.  What does each of them stand for?

RSS is the Resident Set Size and is used to show how much memory is allocated to that process and is in RAM.  It does not include memory that is swapped out.  It does include memory from shared libraries as long as the pages from those libraries are actually in memory.  It does include all stack and heap memory.

VSZ is the Virtual Memory Size.  It includes all memory that the process can access, including memory that is swapped out, memory that is allocated, but not used, and memory that is from shared libraries.

There is also a new measure PSS(Proportional Set Size) that tracks shared memory as a proportion used by the current process.

| | RSS | PSS | VSZ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Program Binary(500KB) | Only Loaded and Non-swapped(400KB) | Same as RSS(500KB) | Full Size(500KB) |
| Shared Libraries(2500KB) | Only Loaded and Non-swapped(1000KB) | RSS evenly partitioned between all processes using(1000KB/2) | Full Size(2500KB) |
| Stack/Heap Allocations(200KB) | Actually in Memory(Non-swapped and Non-unused)(100KB) | Same as RSS(100KB) | Full size(200KB) |
| Size | 1500KB | 1000KB | 3200KB |
