## FAQ

### Can Virtual Classes(Interfaces) in C++ have Member Variables?

Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a "virtual class" or "interface" in C++. If there is, it is artificial, i.e., developer-enforced. Generally, an interface has these characteristics:

- Declared within a namespace and may have public or private accessibility. Only public interfaces are emitted to metadata.
- It can include properties, methods and events.
- All interface members are implicitly public and virtual.
- Fields and static members are *not* permitted.
- Types that are used as properties, method parameters, or return values can only be fundamental types and enum class types.

So the answer is

- **No**, if you want an interface.
- **Yes**, if you just use abstract classes, but make them private and use public getters and setters.
