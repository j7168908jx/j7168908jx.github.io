## Block-cyclic Matrix Visualization

Block-cyclic distribution is a data distribution scheme used in parallel computing, particularly in the context of ScaLAPACK (Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage). It is designed to efficiently distribute large matrices across multiple processors in a distributed memory environment.

This post provides an online tool to visualize the block-cyclic distribution of a matrix across a grid of processors.
