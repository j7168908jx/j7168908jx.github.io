To quote from Hemingway’s Dec. 10, 1954 acceptance speech on winning the Nobel Prize in Literature:

> Writing, at its best, is a lonely life. Organizations for writers palliate the writer’s loneliness but I doubt if they improve his writing. He grows in public stature as he sheds his loneliness and often his work deteriorates. For he does his work alone and if he is a good enough writer he must face eternity, or the lack of it, each day.

My new homepage was posted yesterday. The key reason to post a new homepage is to have Posts section in it. (As the new homepage currently is, at the time this page is written.) Another reason is that there is not much theme and design in the previous homepage, which I found was important to set up my blogging mood. Hence, I spent three days coding this new homepage and adding the post feature to it. Much design philosophy inside this version is inspired by [Bert Hubert's writings](https://berthub.eu/articles/).

My Ph.D. advisor, [Yingzhou Li](https://yingzhouli.com/), is the first one who suggested that I should write posts to improve my writing skill and he also recommended [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll), which is super useful for blog-style web designing. Due to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Disneyland&reg; right before Halloween, I was unfortunately affected and blocked in Huawei and then home, for a total of 10 days. This unexpected incident made me bored (staying at home) but reluctant to do any research. As a time killer, I started googling [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and after 3 days of tuning styles, the homepage is now here. Jekyll is a great system to write posts using my favorite colors and styles in one simple SCSS/CSS line.

As mentioned earlier, the main purpose of my posting is to improve my academic writing skill whereas I prefer writing down various notes here as well. I will share my understanding of papers, algorithms, or theorems. The frequency of posts is not guaranteed. But I will try my best to post at least one every two weeks (on average).

Hopefully, you will enjoy my posts. Clicking the tree in the sidebar, an email would pop out. You are welcome to send me discussions and suggestions.
