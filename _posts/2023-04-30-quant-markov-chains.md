### Markov Chain

1. Equations for absorption probabilities
  - unique solutions to equations $a_s = 1, a_i = 0$ for absorbing states, and $a_i = \sum_{j=1}^{M}a_{j}p_{ji}$ for transient states
2. Equations for the expected time to absorption
  - $\mu_i = 1+\sum_{j=1}^{M}\mu_{j}p_{ji}$ for transient states and $\mu_i = 0$ for absorbing states
3. Gambler's ruin problem
4. Dice question
  - single 12 or dual 7
5. Coin triplets
6. Color balls (very difficult)

### Martingale and Random walk

1. Wald's Equality
  - A martingale stopped at a stopping time is a martingale
2. Drunk man
3. Dice game revisit
4. Ticket line
  - price 5 and $2n$ people having 5 and 10 bills
5. Coin sequence
  - $n$ heads in a row (typist monkey problem)
  - <details><summary>
    We generalize this problem to have a $1/6$ chance of getting head (or a six from a dice), and $5/6$ of getting tail (or except a six from a dice), and we want to obtain a given sequence, say $HHTTHHHTT$, what is the expected number of tosses needed?
