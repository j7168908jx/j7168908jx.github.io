In this page, I collect some questions that are frequently asked in interviews for quantitative researchers. The questions are categorized by topics.

Hopefully, you will find interesting questions and enjoy solving them.
Several questions are not attached with answers. If you have any ideas, please feel free to share them in the comments and I will edit and update the answers to the answer page.
